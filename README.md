## Creator Notes

I really appriciate you checking out my work, it took countless of hours and all nighters to finish this one and it was very fun and I loved just seeing the website cometogether piece by piece.
I made this as a learning project after learning MERN stack and it taught me a lot of things and I after its completition i want to move on to explore more technologies.
P.S. it still lacks responsiveness :P
