## Creator Notes

I really appreciate you checking out my work. It took countless hours and many all-nighters to finish, its still not complete and probably never will be cause I can think of a lot of features that I can still add to this project. It was very fun, and I loved seeing the website come together piece by piece. I made this as a learning project after learning the MERN stack, and it taught me a lot of things. After its completion, I want to move on to explore more technologies. Any feedback is much appriciated...

P.S. It still lacks responsiveness :P
